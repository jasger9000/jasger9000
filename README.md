### `$ whoami`

Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm a hobbyist programmer, and student, from Germany.

I mainly program in Rust ðŸ¦€ and Java â˜• (and if I have to also Java-/TypeScript).
But I also know C and C# and some scripting languages like lua, python or bash


### `$ where work`

I usually develop any application I need for my daily computing needs, like for example [mpDris](https://github.com/jasger9000/mpDris). Or just anything that interests me at the moment or that I want to learn more about.
But as a general rule of thumb you could say: If it is low-level, I'm interested.


### `$ htop`

I'm currently working on getting a deeper understanding of Rust, writing a number of small applications to accomplish that. And getting to know the deeper workings of linux (I use arch btw).


### `Contact (yes, I know boring)`
